Task List and Coding Order
Initialize Hardhat Project
Run npx hardhat to create a new Hardhat project.

Set Up Project Structure
Create necessary directories (contracts, scripts, test).

Write the Smart Contracts
Migrations.sol: Helps with deploying contracts to the Ethereum network.
Stablecoin.sol: Main contract containing logic for minting, managing, and burning the stablecoin.

Set Up Hardhat Configuration
hardhat.config.js: Configure networks, solidity version, and other settings.

Develop Deployment Scripts
deploy.js: Script to deploy the smart contracts to the blockchain.

Develop Interaction Scripts
interact.js: Script to interact with the deployed smart contracts, such as invoking minting and burning functions.

Write Test Cases
stablecoin.test.js: Write unit tests to test all functionalities of Stablecoin.sol.

Prepare for Deployment and Testing
Set up local blockchain with Hardhat or Ganache for testing the deployment and interaction scripts.

Files to be Coded
Smart Contracts (/contracts)
Stablecoin.sol: Contains the functionality for the stablecoin operations.

Configuration Files
hardhat.config.js: Configuration for Hardhat environment.

Deployment Scripts (/scripts)
deploy.ts: Handles the deployment of the smart contracts to the Ethereum network.

Test Scripts (/test)
Stablecoin.test.ts: Tests for validating the functions of the Stablecoin.sol smart contract, ensuring they behave as expected under various scenarios.
