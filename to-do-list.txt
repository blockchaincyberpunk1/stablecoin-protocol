To-Do List
Set Up the Project
 Initialize the Hardhat project using npx hardhat.
 Install necessary npm packages: npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai.
 Set up Hardhat configuration in hardhat.config.js with the desired network settings and compiler configurations.

Develop Smart Contracts
 Write the Stablecoin.sol smart contract, implementing functions for minting, managing, and burning the stablecoin.
 Implement access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can mint or burn the coin.
 If applicable, integrate oracles (e.g., Chainlink) for real-time fiat currency or asset data.

Testing
 Write comprehensive tests in the test/ directory using JavaScript with Hardhat’s testing framework.
 Ensure all smart contract functions behave as expected under various conditions.
 Run tests using npx hardhat test.

Deployment
 Create deployment scripts in the scripts/ directory.
 Deploy to a local testnet using Ganache or Hardhat’s inbuilt network for preliminary testing.
 Deploy to public test networks (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten) for live testing.

Front-End Integration (Optional)
 Develop a simple front-end using HTML/CSS/JavaScript to interact with the smart contracts.
 Use Web3.js or Ethers.js to connect the front-end with Ethereum blockchain.

Documentation and Maintenance
 Document the smart contract functions and their uses.
 Prepare a maintenance plan for updating the smart contracts or handling discovered issues.

Security Audits
 Conduct internal audits.
 Optionally, hire external auditors to ensure the contract is secure before mainnet deployment.
